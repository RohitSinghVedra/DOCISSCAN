# Critical: Verify Client ID Exact Match

## The Problem
The error persists even though the origin is registered. This usually means:
1. **The Client ID in Netlify doesn't match the one in Google Console**, OR
2. **Multiple OAuth clients exist and we're using the wrong one**

## Step-by-Step Verification:

### 1. Check Netlify Environment Variables
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → Your Site → **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Find `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
3. **Copy the FULL value** (it should be very long, ending in `.apps.googleusercontent.com`)

### 2. Check Google Cloud Console
1. Go to Google Cloud Console → **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
2. Find the OAuth 2.0 Client ID named **"DOCIDSCAN"**
3. Click on it to open
4. Look at the **Client ID** field (should show the full ID)
5. **Copy this FULL Client ID**

### 3. Compare Character-by-Character
The Client IDs should be **EXACTLY** the same:
```
29205515218-569db55486d5apli4uqn2uvm3dqg0gbg.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

**Common Issues:**
- ❌ Extra spaces (beginning or end)
- ❌ Different characters (`0` vs `O`, `1` vs `I`)
- ❌ Missing parts
- ❌ Using a different Client ID (maybe an old one or one for a different project)

### 4. Check Console Logs
After the new deployment, check your browser console. You should now see:
```
=== Google API Initialization ===
Full Client ID: [the full ID]
Expected Client ID: 29205515218-569db55486d5apli4uqn2uvm3dqg0gbg.apps.googleusercontent.com
Client ID Match: true/false
```

**If `Client ID Match: false`**, then we found the problem!

### 5. Check for Multiple OAuth Clients
1. In Google Cloud Console → **Credentials**
2. Look for **ALL** OAuth 2.0 Client IDs
3. Make sure you're using the **correct one** (the one with `29205515218-569...`)

### 6. If Client IDs Don't Match:
1. Update `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in Netlify with the **exact** Client ID from Google Console
2. Remove any spaces before/after
3. Save in Netlify
4. Wait for Netlify to redeploy
5. Hard refresh browser (`Ctrl + Shift + R`)
6. Try again

## Alternative: Double-Check Origin Registration

Even if Client IDs match, also verify:

1. In Google Console, for the Client ID:
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins** contains: `https://docidscan.netlify.app`
   - Make sure there's **NO trailing slash**
   - Make sure it's exactly `https://` (not `http://`)

2. **OAuth consent screen** → **Authorized domains**:
   - Should include: `netlify.app` (or add it)

## After Verification:

1. Check the console logs after new deployment
2. Look for `Client ID Match: true`
3. If false, fix the Client ID in Netlify
4. Report back what you find!
