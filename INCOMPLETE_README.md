# Current Status - Frontend-Only Implementation

## What's Done ✅
1. Google Sign-In works (Firebase Auth)
2. Added Google Sheets API service (`googleAuth.js`)
3. Updated Dashboard to connect Google account via frontend
4. Added `gapi-script` dependency
5. Added Google API scripts to HTML

## What's Needed ❌
1. **Document Processing**: The `CameraScan` component still tries to call backend API for OCR
2. **Solution Options:**
   - Use Tesseract.js directly in frontend (browser-based OCR)
   - OR host a simple OCR microservice separately

## Current Issue
The app tries to call `/api/documents/process` which returns 502 because Netlify Functions aren't working.

## Next Steps Needed
1. Install `tesseract.js` in frontend
2. Update `CameraScan.js` to use Tesseract.js for OCR instead of backend
3. Add Google Sheets API Key to Netlify environment variables
4. Test the complete flow

**Would you like me to:**
1. Implement Tesseract.js for frontend OCR? (recommended)
2. OR keep it simple for now and skip OCR - just save raw images to Sheets?

Let me know which approach you prefer!
