# CRITICAL: Still Seeing API Key Error? Do This:

## The Real Problem

Your browser has **OLD cached JavaScript** that's still loading. Even though Netlify rebuilt with the fix, your browser is using cached files.

## Solutions (Try in Order):

### 1. Incognito Window (FASTEST - 10 seconds)
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + N` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + N` (Mac)
2. Go to: `https://docidscan.netlify.app/login`
3. Click "Continue with Google"
4. **Should work!**

### 2. Hard Refresh (20 seconds)
1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. **Right-click the refresh button** while DevTools is open
3. Click **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**
4. Close DevTools
5. Try again

### 3. Clear Site Data (30 seconds)
1. Press `F12`
2. Go to "Application" tab
3. Click "Clear site data" button
4. Refresh page

## If STILL Not Working:

Check the actual API key in Firebase Console:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/iddocscan/settings/general
2. Scroll to "Your apps"
3. Copy the **actual** apiKey
4. Tell me what it is, and I'll update the code

## Quick Test:

Open in a new incognito window - this bypasses ALL browser cache. If it works there, it's just a cache issue.

**Try Option 1 (Incognito) right now - it should work!**
