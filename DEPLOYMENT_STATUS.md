# 🚀 Deployment Status - Frontend-Only Implementation

## ✅ What's Been Implemented:

1. **Google Sign-In** (Firebase Auth) - Working ✅
2. **Tesseract.js OCR** - Added to frontend ✅
3. **Google Sheets API Integration** - Frontend service created ✅
4. **Camera & Upload** - Both options ready ✅
5. **Document Processing** - OCR service implemented ✅

## 📦 New Dependencies Added:
- `tesseract.js` - Browser-based OCR
- `gapi-script` - Google APIs wrapper

## ⚠️ One More Configuration Needed:

### Add Google API Key to Netlify:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/docidscan/configuration/env
2. Add this environment variable:
   - Key: `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY`
   - Value: Get from https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
3. Find or create an API Key in Google Cloud Console
4. Enable these APIs for that key:
   - Google Sheets API
   - Google Drive API
5. Save in Netlify

## 🧪 Testing After Deploy:

1. Sign in with Google
2. Connect Google account (this will create a spreadsheet)
3. Scan a document (camera or upload)
4. Wait for OCR processing
5. Check if data appears in Google Sheets

## ⚡ Expected Behavior:

- OCR processing happens in the browser (first run downloads ~2MB of language data)
- After processing, data is appended to your Google Sheet
- No backend calls needed!
