# Netlify Functions Setup Issue

## Problem
The backend API is returning 502 errors because Netlify Functions can't load the server dependencies.

## Current Status
- ✅ Frontend works (React app deployed)
- ✅ Firebase Auth works (Google Sign-In successful)
- ❌ Backend API returns 502 (Functions not working)

## Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy Backend Separately (EASIEST)
Deploy the backend to a different service like:
- Railway.app
- Render.com
- Fly.io
- Or keep MongoDB version and deploy to Heroku

Then update frontend to call that backend URL.

### Option 2: Fix Netlify Functions (COMPLEX)
Need to:
1. Bundle all server dependencies properly
2. Handle dynamic imports in serverless environment
3. Set up proper function routing

### Option 3: Use External API Service
Use a service like:
- Supabase
- Firebase Extensions
- Or other BaaS for the API layer

## Recommendation
Since the main feature (document scanning + saving to Google Sheets) can work directly from frontend with some modifications, we could:
1. Keep Firebase Auth on frontend
2. Directly call Google Sheets API from frontend
3. Skip the Express backend entirely

This would be much simpler!

## Next Steps
**What would you prefer?**
1. Deploy backend to separate service (Railway/Render)
2. Simplify to frontend-only with direct Google APIs
3. Try to fix Netlify Functions (complex)

Let me know which approach you want to take!
